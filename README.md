Helper functions from https://learnopengl.com/ by (https://twitter.com/JoeyDeVriez) are used for shader loading, handling inputs, moving the camera etc. You can see his original repository (licensed under CC) here: https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL

Requirements:
Requires: STB_IMAGE, glad, OpenGl Mathematics (glm), GLFW
Binaries for GLFW will need to be generated and properly linked (Download the correct binaries from https://www.glfw.org/ and add to include, then link in CMakeList.txt)

Future expansion is to add proper normals for realistic lighting.
